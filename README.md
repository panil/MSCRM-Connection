# MSCRM-Connection
Another way to connect MSCRM in single step in c#

For a test create a sample console application in .Net 4.0 Framework.

Open Nuget Package Manager Console.

PM> Install-Package CRMConnection

After installed this package you can see the Read Me.txt inside your project.
Replace the Console Main function from there and you can use the CRM Service object for CURD operation.

Thanks.
